**AI/ML for Healthcare**\
My research focuses on developing advanced AI systems to deepen our understanding of complex biological processes and drive impactful advancements in healthcare. By leveraging causal learning and inference on multimodal data — including the detailed modeling of biological networks like brain connectomes — I aim to reveal fundamental structures and relationships that can guide more accurate diagnostics and innovative therapeutic approaches.


I am a computer science graduate student at the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in UMass Amherst. This summer I am a ML research intern at [IOMICS Corporation](https://iomics.ai/), where I focus on building automated casual discovery/estimation pipelines and researching Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for their applicability in the unsupervised and supervised domains.

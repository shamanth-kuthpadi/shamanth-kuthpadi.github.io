I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. Deepak Ganesan.\nMy research interests lie in developing end-to-end machine learning pipelines that can be leveraged for impactful advancements in healthcare. The hope is that by doing so, I can help optimize healthcare outcomes and ultimately compute for the common good. I also have a keen interest in designing these ML pipelines in an explainable and interpretable way (whenever possible).\nI am also a part-time research intern under the supervision of Dr. Daniel D. Corkill at IOMICS Corporation, where I focus on building automated casual discovery/estimation pipelines and researching Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for their applicability in the unsupervised and supervised domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nNovember 2025: Admitted to UMass Amherst to pursue a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Deepak Ganesan. I would like to firstly thank my parents for supporting me through this journey and I would also like to thank Prof. Ganesan for taking a chance on me. Special thanks to Dr. Daniel D. Corkill and Prof. Cameron Musco for their supervision through the procedure as well.\n\n\nAugust 2025: Finally “finished” creating my personal website.\n\n\nFebruary 2025: Working under the supervision of Prof. Deepak Ganesan and with Wireless and Sensor Systems Lab to create a multi-modal system for real-time 3D facial animation from physiological signals.\n\n\nJanuary 2025: Working with Mendel.ai to mitigate hallucinations in clinical summarization using synthetic data generation and preference tuning.\n\n\nJanuary 2025: Starting my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\n\nDecember 2024: Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\n\nSeptember 2024: Began my Independent Study in modeling and analyzing structural brain connectomes under the supervision of Cameron Musco\n\n\nJune 2024: Started working as a Machine Learning Research Intern at IOMICS Corporation\n\n\nSeptember 2021: Started my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Publications & Current Research\nA Smart Electrode-Integrated Cooling Patch for Motion-Robust ECG Monitoring and Real-Time 3D Facial Animation\n T. Q. Trung, S. K. Seethakantha, Z. Lei, A. Radmehr, P. Nguyen, D. Ganesan\nSubmitted to Nature Communications\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Discovery Automation: Path to Democratizing Science\n J.
